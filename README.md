### Plans for future
- Fix issues
- Add custom hotkey for jump initiation
- Add support for standard markdown links
- Refactor draw modal and use API functionality

### How to install the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `vault/.obsidian/plugins/plugin-id/`.

### Known issues
- When there are many links (more than English letters) others will appear with `undefined` keyword and can't be 
activated.
